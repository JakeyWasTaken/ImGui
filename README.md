Roblox Dear ImGui

# Notes:

Windows are outside of the widget architecture, they are the building block for everything else. You cannot have multiple windows at once i.e ImGui.Begin() ImGui.Begin(). This may be supported by Dear ImGui but I enjoy the little sanity I have left

Windows data is stored in Internal.Context.ActiveWindow
